#NSLogger-iPad-Viewer


NSLogger viewer app on iPad

Derived from [Florent Pillet's NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger), NSLogger iPad Viewer lets you collect an application's log to an iPad.

##Minimum Requirements
iOS 5.1 and upward<br/>
iPad 2 or iPad mini<br/>
<sup>*</sup>iCloud not supported.

##Status

UI W.I.P.  
Bonjour-Over-Bluetooth Client W.I.P.  
Bonjour-Over-Bluetooth Server Done.

There are four Bluetooth APIs opened in iOS  
1. [CoreBluetooth](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html)  
2. [External Accessary](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ExternalAccessory/Reference/ExternalAccessoryFrameworkReference/_index.ht]ml)  
3. [GameKit](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/GameKit/Reference/GameKit_Collection/_index.html)  
4. [Bonjour over Bluetooth](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1753/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40011315)  

The one that is most clutter-free and provides best possible use case is, so far in my opinion, the last one.



##Documents
As soon as ver 1.0 comes out, iPad viewer will go to [the main repository](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) with documents.<br/>
