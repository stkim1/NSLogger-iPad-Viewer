#NSLogger-iPad-Viewer

Derived from [Florent Pillet's NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger), NSLogger iPad Viewer is an in-field logging tool to monitor your mobile application's behavior in unfabricated, real-world environments. NSLogger iPad Viewer makes use of Bluetooth connection to transmit an application's logging traces.

This is extremely useful to monitor how your application behaves on cellular network, handles GPS data, and/or, treats frequent data exchange with backend.

##Minimum Requirements
iOS 5.1 and upward  
iPad 2 / iPad mini or higher  
<sup>*</sup>iCloud not supported.

##Documents, Example, and/or Wiki
You will see them at [the main repository](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger). All pull requests and issues are only accepted from there.  

##Status
As of today (May 9, 2013), I split the repo into two branches; release & development.   

A release version of 0.4 would be highly limited in terms of UI. Nontheless, its underlying logics are essentially the same as the development version and you could capture logging traces with WiFi/Bluetooth connection.    

Ver 0.4 is tested on iPad 2 for receiving 17,160 logging traces with 1,946 images for an hour. I believe it is stable enough to deploy outside.  

### Work-In-Progress
UI : Preference/Multi-Window/Search

## How to run demo
1. Run NSLogger iPad Viewer with WiFi off and Bluetooth on from Setting.  
2. Run iOS client with Bluetooth on. (It's up to you to leave WiFi or cellular on).        
3. Start logging. Look at the Bluetooth mark on top right corner. :)
